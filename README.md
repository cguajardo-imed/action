A GitHub Action that uses Gitleaks to scan repositories for secrets, keys, and other sensitive information.

## Description

This action runs [Gitleaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks), an open-source tool for detecting hardcoded secrets like passwords, API keys, and tokens in git repositories. It helps identify potential security vulnerabilities in your codebase.

## Usage

Add this action to your GitHub workflow:

```yaml
name: Scan for secrets

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  gitleaks:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      
      - name: Run Gitleaks
        uses: your-username/gitleaks-action@v1
        id: gitleaks
      
      - name: Get Gitleaks Report
        if: always()
        run: echo "${{ steps.gitleaks.outputs.report }}"
```

## Inputs

| `report_format`| Format of the report to generate | No     | `json`  |
| `scan_type`    | Type of scan to perform      | No       | `dir`   |

## Outputs

| Output         | Description                  |

## How It Works

This action:

1. Uses the official Gitleaks Docker image
2. Scans your repository for potential secrets
3. Generates a report in the specified format
4. Makes the report available as an action output

## Security Notes

- This action helps identify potential security issues but is not a guarantee against all security vulnerabilities
- False positives may occur, review the results carefully
- Consider using this in combination with other security tools for comprehensive protection
